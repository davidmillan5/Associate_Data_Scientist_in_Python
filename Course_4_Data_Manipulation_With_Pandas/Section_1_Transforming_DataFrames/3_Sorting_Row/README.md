# Sorting rows
Finding interesting bits of data in a DataFrame is often easier if you change the order of the rows. You can sort the rows by passing a column name to .sort_values().

In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.
