# Calculations with .groupby()
The .groupby() method makes life much easier. In this exercise, 
you'll perform the same calculations as last time, except you'll 
use the .groupby() method. You'll also perform calculations on 
data grouped by two variables to see if sales differ by store type 
depending on if it's a holiday week or not.
