# Subsetting with .loc[]
The killer feature for indexes is .loc[]: a subsetting 
method that accepts index values. When you pass it a 
single argument, it will take a subset of rows.

The code for subsetting using .loc[] can be easier to 
read than standard square bracket subsetting, which can 
make your code less burdensome to maintain.
