# Adding new columns
You aren't stuck with just the data you are given. Instead, you can add new columns to a DataFrame. This has many names, such as transforming, mutating, and feature engineering.

You can create new columns from scratch, but it is also common to derive them from other columns, for example, by adding columns together or by changing their units.

homelessness is a DataFrame containing estimates of homelessness in each U.S. state in 2018. The individual column is the number of homeless individuals not part of a family with children. The family_members column is the number of homeless individuals part of a family with children. The state_pop column is the state's total population.
