# Pivoting on one variable
Pivot tables are the standard way of aggregating data in 
spreadsheets.

In pandas, pivot tables are essentially another way of 
performing grouped calculations. That is, the .pivot_table() 
method is an alternative to .groupby().

In this exercise, you'll perform calculations 
using .pivot_table() to replicate the calculations you 
performed in the last lesson using .groupby().
